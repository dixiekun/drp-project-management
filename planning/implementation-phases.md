- **Documentation**: Document complex logic inline
- **Testing**: Write tests as you build features
- **Accessibility**: Consider accessibility from the start
- **Performance**: Profile and optimize regularly
- **Security**: Validate inputs, sanitize outputs, use parameterized queries
- **Mobile-First**: Design and test mobile experience continuously

### Git Workflow

```
main (production)
  └── develop (staging)
       ├── feature/client-management
       ├── feature/kanban-board
       └── feature/time-tracking
```

### CI/CD

- Run linting on every commit
- Run tests on every PR
- Auto-deploy develop branch to staging
- Manual deploy to production from main
